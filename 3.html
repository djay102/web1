  <h2>ANIMATION</h2>
  <p>So here we are INT reader friends, somewhere that doesn’t seem quite real but extremely uncertain. These are strange and scary times, but hopefully these mighty doses of mind-boggling creativity can provide some sort of relief. I, for one, am always perked up by the weird and wonderful works (and words) of Sophie Koko Gate. She’s no stranger to us over here, famous for causing that spine-tingling sensation through a number of rather gnarly animations like Love for instance.</p>
