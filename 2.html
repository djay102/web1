  <h2>ILLUSTRATION</h2>
  <p>The portfolio of artist Ellie Andrews was brought to our attention on International Womxn’s Day when our pal Rose Pilkington named her as one of the ten creatives who inspire her. And we’re mighty glad Rose did, because Ellie’s work is right up our street. Originally from London, Ellie is now based in San Francisco where she makes paintings, ceramics and graphics, and also teaches on an After School Program teaching art to local youth.</p>
